# dota-analytical-project
A repository containing necessary code to perform machine learning analysis on the OpenDota API.

# Clustering
A python notebook file (.ipynb) titled dota_clustering.pynb contains the code used to create the clusters and associated graphs. 
This file can be found at dota-analytical-project/src/Cluster/ and can be ran on any python notebook platform such as Jupyter Labs or Google Colab.

# Classification

## KNN/RandomForest

Inside this notebook file contains segments of code used to densify the dataset, including grouping heroes and abilities into partitions. These partitions were used to help determine if a game will be classified as a win or a loss. Confusion matrices and other classifier metrics are available in the notebook as well.
